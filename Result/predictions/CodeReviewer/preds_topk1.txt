I think this is a bit confusing. How about: > When enabled, HIP will load the kernels and setup the function symbol map on program startup. When enabled, HIP will load the kernels and setup the function symbol map on program startup.
I think we should just use `dataTransfer.items[0]` here.
This is a deep copy of the VolumeSpec, so we don't need to do it again.
This is the only place where we use `wantErr` and `gotErr` to check if the error is equal.

I think this is a bug. The `@` character is not escaped.
I think this should be `IHasHttpUrl`
I think we should check if the prefix exists before doing the put.

I think we can remove this check now

This is not needed.
This is a bit confusing, but I guess it's fine.
This is not correct. The block is not in the list of conflicting blocks.
This is a BC break.
I think this should be `typeof opt_port === 'function'`.

I think we should also set the `Status` to `Unknown` here.
I think this should be `/^[a-f0-9]*$/`
This is not a good idea. The vote provider is not a vote provider.

I think we should keep this method and just call the new one with the new password.

Why is this being changed?

I think we should also update the task data in the state.

I think this should be `\n` instead of `\n`

This file should be reverted.

I think we should add a new type for this, as we are not using it anywhere else.
I think this should be `completed_trails/trail`

This test is no longer relevant.
I think this should be named `IMvxOverridePresentationAttribute`
This is the fix.

This is not needed.

This is a bit of a weird import order.
This is not a good idea. The register is not a valid register.

I think this should be `options[:page_ranges] ||= []`
I think this should be in the `libkbfs` package.
This is a bit confusing. Why not just use `PParam.prefix`?
I think this should be `toggle=True`
This should be `UINT8`
I think this should be `Time.zone.now`
I think we should add a `isInitialized` metric to the `ContainerizationMetricsImpl` class.
I think we should also unregister the `drwrap_event_bb_app2app` and `drwrap_event_bb_instrumentation` events.
Why is this needed?
This is a breaking change. We should keep the old signature and add a new one.
This is not needed, as `resolveReadPreference` already sets the read preference.
I think this is wrong. The block number is the number of blocks in the trie, not the number of blocks in the block chain.
I think this test is not needed anymore.
Line is too long. [81/80]

`push_front_preference`  `push_front_preference`  `info_a`  `push_front_preference`

Why this change?
I think we should throw an exception here.

I think we should use `GetCurrentMethodName` here.
I think we should add this to the `meta` dict above.
I think we should move this to `webserver/views/api_tools.py`

Why is this change needed?
I think this should be `order('position ASC').last == approval`
>Defines whether the JSON RPC tracers will have timeout enabled. Default timeout is 5 seconds per tracer usage. [](start = 8, length = 96) I think this should be "Defines whether the JSON RPC tracers will have timeout enabled. Default timeout is 5 seconds per tracer usage."
I think we should use `URI` instead of `URI` here.
I think this should be `filter` instead of `filter`

I think we should keep the `opae/manage.h` include.
nit: I think we should use `klog` here
I think this is a bug. If `ptr` is nullptr, we should return.

This is not needed.

This is not needed.
I think we should use `form-group` instead of `col-xs-12`

I think this should be `from scapy.error import Scapy_Exception`
I think this is a good change, but I think it's better to keep the pylint disable.

This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a problem.
I think this should be `/usr/share/ansible/roles`

This is a BC break.

Why did you change this?

This is the only place where we need to change the teleports.

I think this test is not needed, since the test is already covered by the `TestFilterApplyError`
I think we should check `ctx.protocol_selector.ratio.http3 > 0` here.

'mongoErrorContextSymbol' is assigned a value but never used no-unused-vars

This test is not needed anymore.
I think this should be `DR_WINDOWS_VERSION_10_1803`

I think we should use `/var/run/nscd/socket` instead of `/var/run/nscd/socket`

I think this is a bug fix.
Missing license header.
I think this is a bit too much detail. I would say that the "the unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, " is a bit too much detail.
I think we should keep this check. If the cleanup is disabled, we should not run the cleanup tasks.
Why remove this?

I think we should keep this, and add a deprecation warning if it's not used.

This is not a date.

I think this should be `FamousLastWords.name`
This is not needed.
I think this should be `with_feature 'RESTRICT_ACCESS' do`

I think this is a bit of a misnomer. The `MDB_store` is a `const mdb_store &` and the `MDB_val` is a `const mdb_val &` and the `MDB_store` is a `const mdb_store &` and the `MDB_val` is a `const mdb_store &` and the `MDB_val` is a `const mdb_store &`

I think this should be `WLR_INFO`
I think we can remove this file.
Why remove this?
This is not needed anymore.

I think we should cancel the grab here, not the view.
I think we should also check that the transaction is not protected.
I think we should use `inversedBy="payments"` here.

I think we should add this to the `ingressClass` field of the `Certificate` struct.
This is a formatting change.
I think this should be `import java.lang.*`
I think you can use `i[0] += 1` here.

I think we should use the same annotation for both replica type and replica type.
I think we should move this to the `onStartSendRequest` method.
I think we should keep the old log message.
This is a bit of a nitpick, but I think it would be better to have a `PropertyDescriptorField` interface that implements `EnumeratedPropertyDescriptor` and `PropertyDescriptorField` and then you can use that interface to create the `PropertyDescriptor`s.
This is a bit confusing. It seems like we are creating a conversion for the same component, but we are not using it.
I think this should be `platform.SiteRunning`
I think this is not needed.
I think we should rename this to `stats_dto_client`
Why did you remove the worker ID?

I think we should use `os.environ.get("PARTITION_ADJUSTMENT", "false")` here.

I think this should be `Task StartAsync(object hint = null);`
I think we should keep the original docstring.
I think this is a bug. The command buffer is not a pointer.

I think this is not needed.
This is a breaking change.
This is a bug fix.
I think this should be in the `.Common` namespace.
Why is this changed?
I think we should keep the name of the option, as it is not really a DNS option.
nit: `// Package pingpong exposes the simple ping-pong protocol`
I think this is a bit of a hack. We should probably just set `r.Retryable` to `nil` if the body is seekable.
I think this should be `Zero indexed`
I think this is wrong. We should not be comparing timestamps.
I think this should be `rc` instead of `rc`
This is a formatting change.
I think we should add a `serialVersionUID` to `StructLike`
I think this is the only place where we need to check if the base class is fully realized.
This is a mistake.

nit: I think this import is unused.
I think we should add this to the `--enable-features` list above.

I think this should be `Kokkos::Tools::Experimental::Impl::idForInstance<HIPInternal>(reinterpret_cast<HIPInternal *>(this));`
I think we should keep this as a `map[string]map[string]common.HclPluginConfig` and have the `PluginConfig` be a `map[string]map[string]common.HclPluginConfig`
This is a good change, but I think we should keep the `require.NoError` here.
I think this is the right thing to do. The `Put` call is blocking, so we need to make sure that we don't block on the `Get` call.
I think we should return `swarm.ZeroAddress` here.
This is a breaking change. We should keep the old code and add a new one.

I think we can remove this file
I think we should add a note that this interface is only available in Kafka.
I think this is a bug.
I think this should be `user_hash[:"#{arg}"] = send(arg)`
I think this should be `@out_variant: (nullable) (out) (transfer full): Metadata`
I think we should use `b.createTLSConfig` here.

This is a breaking change. Please add a new line at the end of the file.
Why is this removed?

I think we should return the error here.
I think we should use `abs_error` here.

Why is this virtual?
I think we should add a `--help` message here.
@saumyasrivastava08 Rename this program to `Is_value_zero.cpp`.

I think we should add a `close()` method to `PageReadStore` interface.
I think we should add a `maybeSetAccount` option to the `accounts` module instead of adding a new one.
I think this should be `this.storage.config.localList.get().map( function( package ) { return { ref: package, score: 1 }; } )`
Please add a space after `if`.
nit: "make one" -> "make one"
I think this is a bit too much. I would just say "Input is type %s, expected datetime. Value: %s"

why not use StringUtils?
I think this should be `LOG.debug`
I think this should be `spiretest`

This is not equivalent.
This is the main fix.
I think it would be better to move this to the `else` branch of the `if` block.
Why did you remove this?
I think we should add a new method `ProxyConfig socks(String type, String host, int port, String username, String password)`
This is not the right URL. It should be `https`.

I think we should remove this class.
This is not needed.
This should be `1.0.2`

I think we should use the same model for both RNN and FPN.
I think this should be `axe.commons.dom.isNativelyFocusable`

I think this should be `module_name.encode('ascii')`
This is the only change that I'm not sure about. The rest is just formatting.

This should be 2012, 2014.
I think this should be `s3.ruby.s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy`
I think we should just use the same name for both.
I think this should be `if runtime.GOOS == "darwin" {`

I think this should be `starred` instead of `starred_only`

This is not a PCI IO protocol instance.
I think we should test the `type` attribute as well.

Why is this removed?
I think this should be `log.Errorf`
This is a bit of a nitpick, but I think it would be better to use `location_map.find(location)` instead of `location_map.size()`.

I think this should be `core_test`
I think we should keep the default value here, and set it to `None` in the constructor.
I think we should call this `start_resource_group_server`
I think we should move this to `pkg/ecr`
I think we can remove this line.

I think we should make this configurable.
I think we should keep the old message.
This is a good change, but I think it's a good idea to keep the mixin around.
I think we should release the stream here.
graph_type graph_data  graph graph graph graph_type graph_impl

I think we should use `past_due` instead of `Past due` here.
I think we should make these public.

Line is too long. [81/80]

This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a problem.

Why is this change needed?
Consensus should be renamed to Engine

I think this can be removed.
This is the only change that I'm not sure about.

I think this should be `simple_dataframe_input`

This is a bit of a nitpick, but I think it would be better to have a `List<T>` and a `Vector<T>` that returns a `List<T>` and a `Vector<T>` that returns a `Vector<T>` and a `List<T>` that returns a `List<T>` and a `Vector<T>` that returns a `List<T>` and a `Vector<T>` that returns a `List<T>` and a `Vector<T>` that returns a `List<T>` and a `Vector<T>` that returns a `
Why did you change this?
This is the only place where we need to create a fake method call.
This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a good idea to have a new key for this.
I think we should add a `omitempty` here.
nit: `nativeS` -> `nativeS`
I think this should be `LOG.finest("Command request: {}", printableArgs);`

I think this should be `bundle == null ? false : bundle.getBoolean(IS_GLOBAL_STORE, false);`
I think we should wrap the record in a `InternalRecordWrapper` instead of wrapping it in a `Struct`.
I think we should add a label here, like `LabelHardwareAccelerationType`
This is not correct. The `else` is not needed.
I think we should keep the old method and just call `apply(path, d.pid)` here.
I think we should check `getAssemblyOptions` first, since it's possible that `getAssemblyOptions` is undefined.
I think we should use `import_` instead of `import_` here.
I think we should add a note here that we don't clone the example group because the new example must belong to the same example group (not a clone).
This is not a valid ID.
I think we should just remove this option.
Why is this change needed?
I think we should check for `ad.DeviceName != ""` here.
I think this should be a `TimeSpan` instead of an `int`

I think we can remove this line too.

I think this should be `Value`
I think we should keep the `remove` component in the `index` folder.
I think we should have a separate mutex for this.
I think we should use `atomic.LoadUint64` here.
I think this is not correct. The wifiStatus is set to `ESPEASY_WIFI_GOT_IP` when the service is initialized.
This is a mock for the api-fetch, not the api-fetch-mock.
Why is this change needed?
I think this is not correct.
This test is not needed, as it's already tested in the previous test.

I think this should be `layouts/visual_website_optimizer_head`

I think we should use `const MongoURIError = require('../../src/error');` here.
I think we should use the same label key for both nodes and devices.
This is a change in behavior. Previously, we would print to stderr and then log to the console. Now we will print to stdout and then log to the console.
This method is used in the `getPluginJS` method. It should be removed.
I think this method should be named `uploadFlowFile`
Why do we need to change this?
This is a bit of a hack, but I'm not sure how to do it better.
I think this should be `apt-get &>/dev/null`
This is a breaking change, and I think it's fine to remove this note.
I think we should keep this test, as it is not testing the `toSortedQueue` method anymore.
I think this should be `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor.new(max_threads: @config[:concurrency])`
I think this is a bug. If `avg_factor` is not specified, then `loss` will be `None` and the `sum()` will be `None`.
Why did you change this?
I think this should be `+=`
I think this should be `kind='bar'`
I think we should log the build result here.
I think this should be `const C015_queue_element& other`
I think this should be `from astroid import nodes`
This is a bit of a smell that we're removing a lot of code from `dask.array`. I think we should just remove this function.
I think this is a good place to put this function.
I think this should be `ZMS_PROP_PRINCIPAL_STATE_UPDATER_FREQUENCY_DEFAULT_MINUTES`
I think we should also check that `thumbnailWidth` and `thumbnailHeight` are set.
I think we should call this `USER_AGENT` to be consistent with the other constants.
I think this is the only place where we need to check if the queue is empty.
This is a change in behavior. Previously, the returned list was a `List` and now it's a `Stream`.
I think this method should be in the `AccountCapabilities` class.
I think we should keep this as is, as it's not a set of selectors.
I think we should remove this field from the API.
This is a breaking change.
I think this is unused.
I think this is a bit confusing. I think we should have a method like `ExecutableUtils.isExecutable(String executable)` that returns true if the executable is executable, and false otherwise.
I think this is the only place where we need to check for the empty string.
I think this should be `Bolt::Util.deep_merge(config, transport: transport, transport => options)`

I think we should call this `campaignID` to be consistent with the other fields.
I think this should be `0.2.0`
I think we should use `cursorOptionNames` here.
I think we can remove this code

I think this should be `sep=sep, **kwargs`
I think we should use `Time.zone.now` instead of `Time.current`.
I think we should return `nil` here.
This is not correct. The destination zone name is "NONE" and the destination zone name is "NONE".
I think this should be `@Nullable`
I think this should be `GetWithCreatable`
I think this is a bug fix. The length of the null string is always greater than 1.
I think this should be `@record.proposal.client_admin?`
I think we can use `.page(1)` here.
I think this is a bit of a hack, but I don't have a better solution.
This should be `2012-2021`
I think this should be `if (freopen(STDERR_FILE, "a", stderr) == NULL) {`
I think this should be `1593493828L`
This is a bit of a nitpick, but I think it would be better to have the `and` on the next line aligned with the `and` on the previous line.
nit: can we call this `nodeCIDRToBlockToRoutes`?
I think this is a good idea. I'm not sure how to test this.
I think this should be `self._format = pkgformat or 'txt'`
I think this should be `List<WebElement>`
This is a bit of a misnomer. It's not a constant, it's a constant that is not resolvable.
Please remove this line
I think we should add a `backend` argument to `Store.custom_options` instead of adding a new one.
I think we should return an error here.
I think this is a bug.
This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a problem.

I think this should be removed.
I think this should be `flux_test.go`
I think we should keep the old names for consistency.
I think this is a bit of a misnomer. I think it should be `GET /help/faq`
I think we can remove this constructor now.
Why remove this?
I think this class should be renamed to `StandardSampleImportTransformer` to match the new name.
This is a bit of a nitpick, but I think it would be better to have the copyright line in the header, so that it's easier to find the file.
I think we should add a note here that this is only applicable to CloudEventOverrides and Sink.
I think we should set this only if ALPN is enabled.
This is not a good idea. It is not a good idea to change the copyright dates.
I think this should be a read lock.
This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a good idea to add a new task for every packet.

I think this should be `y=1.05`
This is a big int, so we need to convert it to a string.
I think this should be called `PersistBlockLevelInfo`
I think this should be `_base_`
I think we can remove this method.
I think this is not needed.

This import is not used.
I think this is a race condition.
I think we should also check for `application/xhtml+xml` here.

I think this should be `.to raise_error(Bolt::Project::InvalidProjectNameError)`
I think this should be `getUnmergedMDUpdates`
I think we should return an error here if the hostname is not set.
I think we should add an index on `approving_official_id` here.

Why did you change this?
This is a bit of a hack, but I'm not sure how to make it work.

This is not a good import.
I think we should use the enum here.
This is a breaking change. We should not change the public API.

This is the only change that I'm not sure about. The rest is just cleanup.

I think this should be `cache.Cache`

I think this should be `!mimxrt1062`
I think this is a good change, but I think it would be better to use `const auto& atom` here.

I think this should be called `prefQueueAddToFront`
I think we should add a `counter` parameter to the `IndexView` constructor, so that we can pass it in the `index_context` and `counter` methods.
This is not needed anymore.

This should be `fields['protocol'] = self.tab_url(idx).scheme()`
This is not needed anymore.
@saumyasrivastava08 Rename this program to `Reverse_number.cpp`.
I think this is a bug. The `.` is not a valid character.

I think this should be `typeForPrimaryKey`
I think this should be "toukyou"

This is not used anymore.
I think this should be `confirmed` instead of `false_positive`
This is a bit weird. Why not just add the exception to the list of exceptions in the method?
I think this should be `(number|undefined)[]|string|(string|undefined)[]|Function|undefined`
I think this is a bit confusing. The `m_additionalSubpassDependencies` is a list of subpass dependencies, and the `m_renderPassDependencies` is a vector of subpass dependencies. I think it would be better to have a `m_additionalSubpassDependencies` list that contains all the subpass dependencies, and then have a `m_renderPassDependencies.data()` method that returns the data for the subpass dependencies.

I think we should use `regexp.MustCompile` here instead of `regexp.MustCompile`
I think this should be `!$params`

This is a bug fix.

Is this used?
I think we should use `UPDATE` instead of `UPDATE` here.

This is the only change that I'm not sure about. The rest is just formatting changes.
I think this should be `isDocker()`

This is a good change, but I think we should keep this.
I think this should be `isDocker()`
I think this is a bug. It should be set to NULL.
I think we should add a `AddTaskEvent` method that takes a `TaskStateChange` and adds it to the `TaskHandler`.

I think this should be `--drive-use-modified-date`
I think we should add a note here that this is a breaking change.
I think this is the only place where we need to use the master index.
This is a bit confusing.

This is a pretty bad idea. It's not a good idea to have a `ToString` method on a `AnyTopic`.

I think this should be `<binary>`
nit: remove empty line
I think we should add a unique index on project_name, uuid, rating, more_info.

This is a breaking change. We should keep the old regex.
nit: can we rename this to `createMetadataTableInstance`?

This should be `2020-2020`
I think this should be `w.WriteByte(t[i])`
File is not `goimports`-ed (from `goimports`)
I think this should be `System.currentTimeMillis() - latestDateInReceivedData < 15L`

This is not used.
This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a problem.
I think we should just remove this test.
This is the only place where we need to change the value of `config.pacUrl`

I think it's fine to deprecate all methods from ASTFormalParameter.

I think we should keep this as is, and add `rvm` to the `DEFAULTS` array below.
This is not correct. The `len` is the length of the `pay` string.

I think this is not correct. The charset is not the default charset.
I think this should be a `ConcurrentDictionary` instead.
I think this should be `observations.where(id: observations.pluck('user_id'))`
I think this is a good change, but I'm not sure why it's failing.

I think this should be `hierarchical_name`
I think we should add a link to the docs here.
I think this should be `DEFAULT_ISMASTER_36`
>null [](start = 51, length = 4) null
I think we should keep the old name for now.
This is a real error, not an error.
I think this is a good change, but I think it would be better to use `expect { driver.find_element(id: 'box0') }.not_to raise_error(WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError)`

I think this class should be removed.
I think this line can be removed.
I think we should keep this, as it's not a test.
nit: import order

I think we should add a new file for this.
This is not needed.
This is not needed.
I think this should be `if not isinstance(feval, list):`
Why is this needed?

This is the only place where we need to call `cdsObjectToUpnpavObject` to get the node.
I think this is a good change, but I think it would be better to have a `func(string) string` that returns the string value of the map. That way we can avoid the need for a function.
I think this is a bug fix. The `listenSocket_` is not set to `-1` when `listenSocket_ == THRIFT_INVALID_SOCKET`.

I think this is a bug fix. The `depValidationStatuses` is a map, not a map.

Why is this change needed?
I think we should log the error here.

I think we should move this to `cmd/rclone/fs/config/provider/config.go`
I think we should return `null` here.
I think we should add a TODO here to allow customizing header prefixes.

I think this is a bit confusing. If the config is set to 0, then we should use the account limits. If the config is set to 0, then we should use the account limits.

I think this should be `this.givenFeeSat = opts.fee || 0;`
I think we should just use `rwm` here.
Why is this change needed?
I think we should use the same value for both of these fields.

This import is not needed.

I think this should be `ruby-(2\.[0-2]\.[0-9]|1\.9\.3)`
I think this should be `d_oy_val / 2.0`
I think this is a good change. I'm not sure what the actual impact of this is.

I think we should have a `StackConfiguration` type that can be used to represent a CloudFormation stack.

This option is not used.

This is the only usage of Http.
I think we should rename this to `ROOT_FIELD_NAME_VALIDATOR`

I think we should add a validation that the path is a valid path.

I think this should be `#if defined(_MSC_VER) && !defined(NOEXCEPT)`

Why is this change needed?
I think we should add a `read.split.partition-by-file-cost` as well.
This is a bug fix.
I think this is a bit confusing. It's not a single owner chunk implemenation, it's a single owner chunk validator.

I think this should be `@Nullable`.
I think this should be `SetGetMetricFunction`
I think this should be `PORT_DYNAMODB_BACKEND_PORT`
This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a problem.
Why is this test disabled?
I think we should add a log here that we are subtracting the base fee from the parent base fee.

I think this is a bug.
I think we should propagate the error here.
Why is this final?
I think we should keep the key check here.
nit: I think we can remove the f-string here
I think we should keep this.
I think this is a good change, but I think it would be better to have a `SnippetSetRunner.Generator` interface that implements `DiscoveryProvider` and `SnippetSetRunner<Method>` and have a `getSnippetSetRunner()` method that returns the `SnippetSetRunner`.
This is a bit of a nit, but I think it would be better to call this `_targetDbForSaves` to make it clear that it's a `IDb` rather than a `Func<bool>`

I think we should add a `ByteSize` method to `Message` interface.
This is the default.

I think we should also test that the headers are case insensitive.
This is a bit confusing. I think it would be better to have a `forAllVisibleModules` that returns a `std::vector<std::string>` of all the modules that are visible. Then you can just call `forAllVisibleModules` with a `std::vector<std::string>`.

I think we should keep the old name for now.
I think this is the right way to get the actual path to the script.

I think we should add a `Required = true` here.

Please remove this empty line.

I think this should be `readonly`
I think we can remove the `false` here now?
missing space after comma
nit: `CHECK(client)` is redundant.

I think we should keep this as a method.
This is a BC break.
I think this should be at least `debug` level.
This is a bit of a hack, but I don't think it's a big deal.

I think we should add a `:transports` to the `MockExecutor` class instead of adding it here.

I think this should be "Every configuration"
This is not needed.
This is a BC break.
This is a bug fix.

I think this should be `unless options[:stdin].nil?`
I think we should use the same default value as the `strictTraceId` and `namesLookback` values.

I think we should use `-1` as the default value here.
This is a formatting change.
Why is this removed?
I think this should return an empty list instead of null.
I think we should keep the old name for now.
I think this is a bit confusing. If there is only one child, then the explicit CE is calculated using the provided regression if any. If there is only one child, then the explicit CE is calculated using the provided regression if any.
I think this is a bit of a hack. I think we should just make `get_plot_frame` return a `Frame` and then we can just call `get_plot_frame` on it.
I think this should be `False`
I think we should return the error here.
This change is not needed.
I think we should use `!rawErrorData.containsKey(CLASS) && !rawErrorData.containsKey(STACK_TRACE)` instead of `rawErrorData.get(CLASS) == null`

This is not used.
This is a bit weird. Why not just have the `#else` block in the `#if DEBUG`?

This is a change in behavior. Previously, the function would return `false` if the function was not found. Now, it returns `true` if the function was found.
